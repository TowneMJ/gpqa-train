Pol \u03b7 possesses an active site architecture that accommodates the relatively symmetric TT CPD, allowing accurate insertion of adenines opposite both bases. However, the 3'-cytosine of a TC CPD creates a steric clash within the Pol \u03b7 active site, preventing efficient error-free bypass. Consequently, in the absence of functional Pol \u03b7, these TC lesions are channeled to the error-prone Rev1/Pol \u03b6 complex, which inserts adenines opposite the damaged cytosine (or facilitates misincorporation), resulting in C\u2192T transitions upon replication. TT CPDs, being proficient substrates for Pol \u03b7, do not accumulate mutations in wild-type cells, and in XP-V cells, they are either bypassed by alternative error-free mechanisms or are poor substrates for the error-prone activity of Pol \u03b6. Option A is incorrect because TC sites form CPDs (not specifically 6-4PPs) and human cells lack photolyases. Option B is incorrect because UV-DDB recognizes both lesion types, and the data specifically implicate translesion synthesis, not NER defects, in the mutagenesis.
