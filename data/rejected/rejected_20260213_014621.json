    "core_concept": "Co-transcriptional RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) formation as a kinetic barrier to spliceosome assembly and the mechanistic basis for dominant-negative interference by ATPase-dead DEAD-box helicase mutants",
    "thinking": "**Correct:** Option C correctly integrates the biochemical mechanism of DEAD-box helicases (which require ATP hydrolysis for substrate remodeling and release) with the kinetic coupling model of co-transcriptional splicing. An ATPase-dead mutant binds its RNA substrate with high affinity but stalls in a dead-end complex, sequestering the rG4 in a structured state that blocks spliceosome access (dominant-negative effect). Accelerating Pol II reduces the temporal window during which the nascent RNA is available for folding; if the rG4 cannot form before the polymerase transcribes past the region, the dominant-negative helicase has no substrate to trap, and the splice site remains accessible for U1 snRNP binding.\n\n**Incorrect:**  \n- **A** is incorrect because it invokes CTD competition, which is not supported by the observation that the E335A effect depends on the presence of the G-rich tract (mutation of which rescues inclusion). If the mutant acted solely via CTD interference, the RNA sequence would be irrelevant.  \n- **B** is incorrect because the question concerns co-transcriptional splice site selection, not post-transcriptional mRNA surveillance. Furthermore, NMD activation would require the presence of a premature termination codon, which is not mentioned and would not explain the specific epistasis between helicase activity and the G-rich tract.  \n- **D** is incorrect because faster Pol II would reduce, not increase, the time available for helicase activity. The rescue of the dominant-negative phenotype by speed is explained by prevention of substrate formation, not enhanced enzymatic activity.  \n- **E** is incorrect because rG4 structures typically inhibit, not promote, spliceosome assembly by sequestering RNA; U1 snRNP recognizes single-stranded splice sites, not G-quadruplexes. The mechanism described contradicts the known inhibitory role of rG4 in this context.",
    "question": "**Question:**  \nWhich of the following best explains the observed relationship between RNA polymerase II elongation kinetics and helicase activity in the regulation of alternative splicing?\n\nA researcher is investigating the inclusion of an alternative cassette exon (Exon 6) that is flanked by suboptimal splice sites. Immediately upstream of the 5' splice site lies a guanine-rich intronic sequence capable of forming a stable RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) structure that physically occludes the splice site, thereby preventing U1 snRNP recruitment and causing exon skipping. The DEAD-box helicase DHX36 normally resolves this rG4 structure to permit spliceosome assembly. The researcher makes the following observations: (1) Slowing RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation with a CDK9 inhibitor increases Exon 6 skipping in wild-type cells; (2) Knockout of DHX36 results in constitutive skipping regardless of Pol II speed; (3) Overexpression of an ATPase-dead DHX36 mutant (E335A) phenocopies the knockout, causing skipping even when Pol II elongation is pharmacologically accelerated; (4) However, when the E335A mutant is overexpressed in cells where the G-rich tract is mutated to prevent G-quartet formation, Exon 6 inclusion is restored.",
    "correct_answer": "The E335A mutant binds to the rG4 structure but cannot resolve it due to defective ATP hydrolysis, thereby \"trapping\" the RNA in a structured conformation that is inaccessible to U1 snRNP; accelerating Pol II elongation kinetically outcompetes rG4 folding, eliminating the substrate for the dominant-negative helicase and permitting splice site recognition.",
    "incorrect_1": "The E335A mutant enhances the affinity of DHX36 for the Ser2-phosphorylated Pol II CTD, thereby competitively inhibiting the recruitment of essential splicing factors to the nascent transcript; accelerated Pol II disrupts this interaction by reducing dwell time at the Ser2 phosphorylation marks.",
    "incorrect_2": "The E335A mutant constitutively activates the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway by remodeling the RNA to expose premature termination codons upstream of Exon 6; faster Pol II outpaces this remodeling, allowing the spliceosome to assemble before NMD factors are recruited.",
    "incorrect_3": "Faster Pol II increases the local processivity of wild-type DHX36 through mechanical force transmitted via the CTD, enabling WT helicase to overcome the inhibitory effects of the E335A mutant through mass action.",
    "incorrect_4": "The rG4 structure normally serves as a docking platform to recruit U1 snRNP via direct interaction with the quadruplex, and the E335A mutant disrupts this interaction; faster Pol II prevents mutant binding by shearing the RNA structure before the helicase can access it.",
