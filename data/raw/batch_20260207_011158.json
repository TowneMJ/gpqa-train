Acute auxin-inducible degradation of CHD4 causes a progressive, specific loss of H3K27me3 at these target sites over 24 hours, without affecting total cellular levels of PRC2 core subunits (EZH2, SUZ12, EED) or global H3K27me3 abundance.\n3. *In vitro* ATPase assays demonstrate that purified CHD4-containing NuRD complex exhibits significantly higher catalytic activity on nucleosome arrays containing H3K27me3 compared to unmodified nucleosome arrays.\n4. A point mutation in the aromatic cage of the second chromodomain of CHD4 (CHD4-CDmut) that abolishes specific binding to H3K27me3 eliminates the loss-of-methylation phenotype observed in experiment 2 when introduced as the sole source of CHD4.\n\nWhich of the following models best explains the mechanistic role of CHD4 in maintaining H3K27me3-mediated silencing at these target genes?\n\n**A)** CHD4 recruits PRC2 to chromatin through direct protein-protein interactions with EZH2, independent of its chromodomain-mediated recognition of H3K27me3.\n\n**B)** CHD4 antagonizes PRC2 activity by actively evicting H3K27me3-marked nucleosomes, thereby limiting the spread of the repressive mark.\n\n**C)** CHD4 stabilizes the silenced state by functioning as a histone chaperone that deposits the replication-independent histone variant H3.3 at Polycomb target sites.\n\n**D)** CHD4 binds H3K27me3 via its chromodomains and remodels adjacent nucleosomes to facilitate PRC2-mediated propagation or maintenance of the methylation mark.\n\n**E)** CHD4 passively protects H3K27me3 from KDM6 demethylases by sterically hindering demethylase access to methylated histone tails.\n\n**Correct Answer: D**\n\n**Explanation:** The experimental data collectively support a model where CHD4 functions as a reader and effector of the H3K27me3 mark to facilitate its own maintenance or spreading. Observation 4 establishes that CHD4 chromodomain binding to H3K27me3 is essential for maintaining the mark, ruling out Option A (which posits chromodomain-independent recruitment). Observation 2 demonstrates that CHD4 loss decreases H3K27me3, contradicting Option B (antagonistic role) which would predict increased methylation upon CHD4 removal. Option C is incorrect because CHD4 is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, not a histone chaperone (H3.3 deposition is mediated by HIRA). Option E is inconsistent with observation 3: passive steric protection would not explain why the ATPase activity of CHD4 is specifically stimulated by H3K27me3-containing nucleosomes. Option D correctly integrates all observations: CHD4 recognizes existing H3K27me3 (observation 4), its enzymatic activity is heightened on methylated substrates (observation 3), and this remodeling activity is necessary to maintain the methylation landscape (observation 2), likely by repositioning nucleosomes to expose adjacent histone H3 tails for PRC2-mediated methylation or by stabilizing the repressive chromatin fiber.",

In an experimental system where G1-synchronized cells are depleted of Ku80 and simultaneously express a phospho-mimetic CtIP mutant (T847E) that bypasses CDK regulation and constitutively promotes 5' to 3' resection, which of the following represents the most likely fate of these DSBs?\n\n**A)** Repair by HR using the sister chromatid as a template, resulting in error-free restoration of the locus  \n**B)** Ligation of unprocessed ends by the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex in the absence of Ku-mediated synapsis  \n**C)** Engagement of alternative end-joining (alt-EJ) utilizing resected single-stranded overhangs and microhomology-mediated annealing  \n**D)** Extensive single-strand annealing (SSA) between dispersed repetitive elements, generating chromosomal deletions  \n**E)** Unrepaired breaks triggering apoptosis via p53-independent activation of the mitotic catastrophe pathway  \n\n**Correct Answer: C**\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer requires understanding the hierarchical and competitive nature of DSB repair pathways. In G1-phase cells, the sister chromatid is absent, precluding HR (eliminating **A**). Canonical NHEJ is absolutely dependent on Ku70/80 for end recognition and recruitment of downstream factors including DNA-PKcs and XRCC4-Ligase IV; without Ku80, this pathway is non-functional, and Ligase IV cannot effectively ligate unprocessed ends (eliminating **B**). Single-strand annealing (**D**) requires the presence of flanking direct repeats (e.g., Alu elements) to allow annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA; the question specifies a \"unique locus,\" making SSA impossible. While unrepaired breaks eventually trigger cell death, the specific combination of Ku loss (which forces repair toward alt-EJ) and forced resection (which provides the necessary 3' overhangs for microhomology exposure) specifically channels these breaks into alternative end-joining (alt-EJ), a backup pathway that uses PARP1/Ligase III and short microhomologies (5\u201325 bp) to religate ends in a Ku-independent manner. Thus, **C** is correct because the genetic manipulation creates the precise conditions\u2014resected ends without Ku protection\u2014that favor alt-EJ over other outcomes. Mitotic catastrophe (**E**) is a downstream consequence of unrepaired damage entering mitosis, but the immediate fate is attempted repair via alt-EJ.",

First, the orientation-dependent blocking activity of the insulator (blocking in forward orientation but not when inverted) and the partial rescue upon CTCF site mutation indicate that the insulator inhibits loop extrusion in a directional manner (via convergent CTCF sites), but also possesses CTCF-independent blocking activity (explaining why expression only reaches 60% when CTCF sites are mutated). Second, the scrambled TFBS experiment demonstrates that enhancer specificity depends not merely on the presence of cognate transcription factors but on their precise spatial arrangement (syntax) to facilitate cooperative interactions or specific condensate formation. Third, and most critically, the forced tethering experiment (which ensures physical proximity) shows that proximity alone is insufficient for activation; the requirement for Mediator phase separation indicates that biomolecular condensate formation is the essential activating step.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the phase separation requirement (Experiment 5) and the stereospecificity demonstrated by the scrambled TFBS experiment (Experiment 4). Option C is incorrect because there is no evidence of eRNA involvement in the experimental design, and the insulator is not acting as a silencer inactivated by CTCF (rather, CTCF binding contributes to the blocking activity). Option D is incorrect because a tracking mechanism would predict sensitivity to distance and insulator orientation in a manner inconsistent with the observation that inversion restores activity; moreover, tracking models do not account for the phase separation requirement. Option E is incorrect because it posits Mediator sliding and steric hindrance as the mechanism, which does not explain why scrambled TFBS motifs fail (they should still recruit Mediator if sliding were sufficient) and contradicts the finding that physical tethering cannot rescue the phase-separation defect.",

This pattern distinguishes between replication slippage at the fork (which would not require gaps behind the fork) and the gap-repair model of expansion. In the gap-repair model, stalling or slowing of the replicative polymerase creates persistent ssDNA regions behind the fork. The CAG repeat-containing strand can fold into stable hairpin structures within these gaps, and subsequent error-prone repair synthesis incorporates these extra loops as permanent expansions.\n\n**Option A** is incorrect because DNA polymerase \u03b4 lacks helicase activity; unwinding is performed by replicative helicases (MCM2-7) or accessory helicases like WRN.

The observation that gaps behind the fork correlate with expansion specifically supports the post-replicative repair mechanism rather than slippage at the fork itself.\n\n**Option C** is incorrect because aphidicolin is a competitive inhibitor of DNA polymerases (mimicking dNTPs); it does not chemically modify DNA bases or directly damage the repeat sequence.\n\n**Option E** is incorrect because DNA polymerase \u03b4 is not a component of the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery.

At the restrictive temperature without aphidicolin, DNA synthesis is abolished and no expansions are detected. At the restrictive temperature with aphidicolin\u2014which permits slow fork progression but causes accumulation of single-strand gaps behind the replication fork\u2014you observe a 10-fold increase in expansion frequency compared to baseline. Which conclusion best explains these observations?\n\n**A)** DNA polymerase \u03b4 actively unwinds CAG hairpin structures during synthesis, and its inactivation prevents expansion by leaving these structures intact.\n\n**B)** Expansion occurs exclusively via replication slippage at the fork, which requires rapid fork progression; the slow progression caused by aphidicolin increases the probability of slippage events.\n\n**C)** Aphidicolin induces direct chemical modification of trinucleotide repeats, increasing their intrinsic mutability independent of replication dynamics.\n\n**D)** Single-strand gaps accumulating behind the replication fork provide a substrate for hairpin formation and error-prone post-replicative repair synthesis.\n\n**E)** DNA polymerase \u03b4 is required for mismatch repair-mediated contraction of repeats, so its inactivation phenocopies MSH2 deficiency and allows uncontrolled expansion.\n\n**Correct Answer: D**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe critical observation is that expansions occur when replication is permitted (synthesis occurs) but increase dramatically when single-strand gaps accumulate behind the fork, while no expansions occur when synthesis is completely blocked. This pattern distinguishes between replication slippage at the fork (which would not require gaps behind the fork) and the gap-repair model of expansion. In the gap-repair model, stalling or slowing of the replicative polymerase creates persistent ssDNA regions behind the fork. The CAG repeat-containing strand can fold into stable hairpin structures within these gaps, and subsequent error-prone repair synthesis incorporates these extra loops as permanent expansions.\n\n**Option A** is incorrect because DNA polymerase \u03b4 lacks helicase activity; unwinding is performed by replicative helicases (MCM2-7) or accessory helicases like WRN. Moreover, if hairpins remained intact, they would block synthesis rather than promote expansion.\n\n**Option B** is incorrect because replication slippage (strand realignment during synthesis) is actually favored by rapid fork progression or transient dissociation of the polymerase, not specifically by gaps behind the fork. The observation that gaps behind the fork correlate with expansion specifically supports the post-replicative repair mechanism rather than slippage at the fork itself.\n\n**Option C** is incorrect because aphidicolin is a competitive inhibitor of DNA polymerases (mimicking dNTPs); it does not chemically modify DNA bases or directly damage the repeat sequence.\n\n**Option E** is incorrect because DNA polymerase \u03b4 is not a component of the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery. Furthermore, MSH2 deficiency typically promotes expansions (not contractions) by stabilizing hairpin structures, whereas the experimental result shows that complete cessation of synthesis (restrictive temp without aphidicolin) abolishes expansion entirely, indicating synthesis is required for the process.",
