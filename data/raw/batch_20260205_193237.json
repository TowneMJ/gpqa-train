However, Compound X inhibits the proteasome, preventing Firefly luciferase turnover.

The editing window of standard CBEs typically spans protospacer positions 4\u20138, meaning cytosines at both position 4 and 6 would be edited, resulting in unwanted bystander mutations. Engineered deaminase variants such as YE1 (containing W90Y+R126E mutations in APOBEC1) have been specifically developed to narrow the activity window to approximately positions 5\u20137. This spatial restriction prevents the deaminase from accessing the bystander cytosine at position 4 while maintaining efficient editing at the target cytosine at position 6, thereby maximizing product purity.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n**A)** APOBEC3A exhibits higher catalytic activity and broader sequence context compatibility compared to APOBEC1, but it does not narrow the editing window; rather, it often increases editing efficiency at all accessible cytosines within the window, exacerbating bystander editing at position 4.\n\n**C)** Removal of the UGI domain converts the CBE into a C-to-G base editor (CGBE) or generates a mixture of C\u2192T, C\u2192G, and indel outcomes. While this alters the repair outcome, it does not selectively exclude position 4 from deamination; both cytosines would still be deaminated, and the resulting repair heterogeneity would not specifically preserve the bystander.\n\n**D)** Replacing the nickase with a high-fidelity nuclease creates double-strand breaks (DSBs). Base editing is designed to circumvent DSBs and the associated indel formation and chromosomal aberrations.

While prime editing can install precise edits without bystander effects, the question specifically asks for a modification to the CBE deaminase domain to solve the window selectivity problem.
