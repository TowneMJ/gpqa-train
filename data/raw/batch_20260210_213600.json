However, MMR excision is processive but limited in tract length (~10\u201320 nucleotides). When a decoy mismatch is placed within this distance (e.g., 5 bp), the excision machinery removes the parental sequence across both the intended edit and the decoy; resynthesis then copies both mutations from the edited strand, permanently retaining the edit. If the decoy is too distant (50 bp), MMR excision typically proceeds only far enough to correct the proximal intended mismatch, using the parental strand as template for resynthesis and thereby reverting the edit, while the distant decoy may be recognized separately or ignored, resulting in low net editing efficiency. Option B is incorrect because the decoy resides in the RT template, not the PBS, and PBS binding occurs prior to RT. Option C is incorrect because FANCM is not the primary determinant of PE efficiency in this context. Option D is incorrect because SMX resolution is not the mechanism of MMR evasion in PE. Option E is incorrect because Cas9(H840A) is nickase-dead in the RuvC domain and its conformation is not allosterically regulated by RT template mismatches.",
