The experimental observation that MutL\u03b1 incises specifically between the pre-existing nick and the mismatch on Substrate 2 (but not on the closed circular Substrate 1, the 3'-nicked Substrate 3, or the homoduplex Substrate 4) demonstrates that MutL\u03b1 possesses endonuclease activity that creates the strand discrimination signal.
